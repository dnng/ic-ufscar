# Virtual Robot Localization Data Gathering

Project code for the Undergraduate Research on Particle Filter Algorithms
conducted at UFSCar - Federal University of Sao Carlos - Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil

## Basic Info

To control a robot using the player framework, you need 3 types of files:

.world
.cfg
.inc

These 3 files _must_ be included within the same folder in order to be
referenced and founded by the program. Any image file referenced by the .world
source code file _also_ _must_ be located in the same folder.
